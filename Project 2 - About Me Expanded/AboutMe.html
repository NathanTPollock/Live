Project:  Project1-About Me
Name: Nathan Pollock
Submitted: 1/21/23
 
I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs): I have written HTML before but since it has been a while this was a perfect refresher to get familiar with the flow and how to navigate
                                the documentation. I found that between the "cheat-sheet" and w3 shools I mostly used the latter and will likely continue to make
                                frequent use of it.
                            I had fun coding this project, in the past the environment I had set-up was not ideal for designing the website however the live feature
                                we set up in class made it very easy and clear to see the changes as you made them. This made the process much more enjoyable for me
                                and I am excited to work on future projects.

            <h2>Aromatic Awakening</h2>
            <p>Dedicated to the Coffee that gets me through the early mornings:<br></p>
            <p><em>Wake to the aroma,<br>Dark brew in a porcelain cup,<br>Morning ritual.<br></em></p>
        </div>

        <h2>My personal interests</h2>
        <p>
            One of my main passions right now is snowboarding. I'm always looking for new ways to push my limits on the mountain. I love the adrenaline I get whenever I
            land a new trick or am one of the first people on the mountain that day to get the freshest powder.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also love music, whether it's listening or playing. I've played the piano on and off my whole life and I've recently begun learning the bass guitar. I'm pretty
            bad at it for now but check back in a few months and I'll be shredding it. My favorite bands/artists at the moment are Moxie, Joji, and Polyphia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, my most memorable experiences come from my travels. I have many travel plans for the future and hope one day to live abroad to explore more of the world. 
            The places I have been include: Spain, England, Peru, Mexico, Canada, and all over the west and east coast of the US.
