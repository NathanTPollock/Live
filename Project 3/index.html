I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs): I unfortunately had a lot of extenuating circumstances delaying my submissions on schoolwork greatly. Coming back to designing
                             a website it has been evident that keeping up with standards and practicing your skills is vital to maintaining your knowledge.
                             While it was time consuming as I had to refresh my knowledge on many topics, it was still enjoyable and good to see everything
                             come together in the end.
